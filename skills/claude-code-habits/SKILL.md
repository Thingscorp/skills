# claude-code-habits

Claude Code instance of **session-hygiene** — read that skill first for the
portable doctrine. This skill is only the Claude-Code-specific mechanics.

## Session checks
- `/context` — verify your context floor after big operations; watch for silent jumps.

## Rewind options (escalating)
1. **Undo / escape-cancel** — cancel mid-run, rewind a few messages.
2. **`/rewind`** — rewind to a point in the conversation.
3. **Slash-command session** — start a clean, scoped session.
4. **`git` recovery** — `git diff`, `git stash`, `git reset` as the last resort. Git is the ground truth.

## Slash commands worth knowing
- `/model` — check the model; switching mid-task changes behavior.
- `/permissions` — manage what the agent may run without asking.
- `/agents` — subagent management.

## Bash modes
- Foreground for interactive; **background** (`&`-style runs) for long jobs you monitor.
- If the harness blocks a command, prefer the supported path over forcing it.

## Settings backup
Back up your settings file (`~/.claude/settings.json`) and skills
directory before labs that reset harness config.
